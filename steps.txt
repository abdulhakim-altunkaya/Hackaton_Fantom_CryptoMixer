dont forget to update ConnectMet component account information

PRODUCTION IMPROVEMENTS 
***You should also let the pool to mature before letting people to withdraw
***Catch errors thrown by contract on the frontend better instead of red screen
***banned private words: after each withdrawal used private key will be encrypted and 
saved inside the array. Later we will check this array to see if encrypted private key is used or not
before sending value to the user. The purpose is, instead of updating mapping hash balance, better to 
save used private keys inside an array. If we dont update balance of the hashes, it will be harder for 
investigators to track the balance movements and associated msg senders.
But you must consider withdrawPart function, as it will need amount data of the mapping.
And still I am not sure if updating balance or hashing private key will leave less track on the blockchain
