<h1>CoinFog</h1>

<p>CoinFog is a privacy-focused crypto mixing project that allows users to obfuscate the source of their funds and enhance the privacy of their transactions on the blockchain. It provides a secure and decentralized platform for users to mix their cryptocurrencies, making it difficult to trace the origin and destination of funds.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>CoinFog utilizes a mixing process that combines the funds of multiple users, making it challenging to associate specific funds with their original sources. The basic steps involved in the mixing process are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Depositing Funds:</strong> Users can deposit their cryptocurrencies into the CoinFog contract. The contract securely receives and holds the deposited funds.</li>
  <li><strong>Mixing Process:</strong> Once a sufficient number of users have deposited funds or a specific time threshold has passed, CoinFog initiates the mixing process. During mixing, the funds from different users are combined and shuffled, breaking the link between the original deposits and the mixed funds.</li>
  <li><strong>Withdrawal:</strong> Users can initiate a withdrawal by providing proof of ownership for the mixed funds without revealing their original deposits. This proof is generated using cryptographic techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), which validate the ownership without disclosing sensitive information.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Features</h2>
